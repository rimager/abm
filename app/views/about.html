        <h2>What does a Board do?</h2>
        <p> The Arts & Business Council has developed a 90 minute leadership seminar for business professionals interested in serving on non-profit boards. The seminar provides basic information on board responsibilities and commitments featuring a panel of board members discussing their involvement. The program highlights the benefits of joining an arts board, business development opportunities for board members, responsibilities of board members and leadership traits of successful boards. Each participant leaves with a Board Checklist: outlining what to ask before joining a board. The leadership seminars are offered through our partners in chambers, business development organizations, business clubs and universities. Corporate members of the Arts & Business Council can schedule a in-house lunch program for their executives and associates interested in board involvement. </p>
