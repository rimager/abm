            <h4>One Billion Reasons Why the Arts work</h4>
            <p>When the board and volunteers of over 1,000 non-profit arts groups in Miami-Dade donned clip boards to conduct surveys with their audience and patrons they wanted to showcase that the arts are an essential part of the economy. Their hard work paid off in a big way. The big news, the drum-roll news, and the exciting results: the arts in Miami-Dade have an impressive annual economic impact of 1.1 billion dollars. From Aventura to Homestead, from Coral Gables to Miami Beach, from downtown to the seashore the arts are everywhere. There are more than 1,200 non-profit arts groups in our community and they employ more than 22,000 full time professionals and workers. “Miami-Dade is a great example of all segments working together for not only economic benefit but artistic as well. We live in a world class global community that is not only naturally beautiful, but also filled with magnificent art and amazing performing groups that showcase our unique past and our diversity while also supporting a cultural life exploding with sounds and sights of an America of the future. There are countless examples like these, and the notion that the arts stimulate the economy in creative and often unrecognized ways is undeniable.</p>
